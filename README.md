# Proof-of-Work
Proof-of-work is a deterant to prevent spamming or recreation of many ledger entries (blocks) and / or recomputation of the blockchain after altering a record in the chain, as all records in a chain are to remain immutable - unchangable and undeletable.

BitCoin requires a number of 0s in a computed hash prior to entry into the blockchain.  This is the "difficulty."  Bitcoin has a goal of 1 block per 10 minutes.
